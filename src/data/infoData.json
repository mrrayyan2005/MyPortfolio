  "about": "MERN stack developer skilled in implementing efficient algorithms using Java. Experienced in applying DSA concepts like Trees, Graphs and Dynamic Programming to solve complex problems.",
  "longAbout": "I'm a B.Tech Computer Science student at Noida Institute of Engineering & Technology with a CGPA of 8.73, specializing in full-stack development and algorithmic problem solving. My technical expertise combines Java for Data Structures and Algorithms with the MERN stack for web development. I have a strong foundation in implementing efficient algorithms using Java's Collections Framework and solving complex problems with optimal time and space complexity. My projects demonstrate practical applications of these skills, including RayyanEstate, a real estate platform with JWT authentication, and an AI Sign Language Learning application that received recognition in the College-level SIH Hackathon. I actively participate in competitive programming and hackathons, where I apply my problem-solving skills to real-world challenges. My approach to development emphasizes clean code, proper architecture, and algorithmic efficiency, whether working on backend systems with Java or full-stack applications with JavaScript technologies.",
